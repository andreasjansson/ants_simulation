A naive Javascript ant colony simulation. Nothing half as complex as
actual Ant Colony Optimisation
(http://irancic.buksna.net/metah/0262042193.pdf), but it's pretty to
look at.

The ants form a subsumption architecture by having a number of
reactive rules govern their behaviour. The rules are ordered by
precedence, and once a rule has applied, no other rules can apply (a
bit like [L] in Apache configurations). These are the rules (ordered by
precedence, descending):

1. If you carry food and you are at the ant hill: Drop the food and
   get a new, random, direction of movement.

2. If you carry food and you are next to the ant hill: Drop pheromone
   and set direction on the ant hill.

3. If you carry food and you are standing on pheromone: Drop pheromone
   and set direction on the pheromone in front of you (if any).

4. If you carry food: Set direction on the ant hill and drop pheromone.

5. If you have found food: Pick up the food, drop pheromone, and set
   direction on the ant hill.

6. If you are standing on pheromone: Set direction on the pheromone in
   front of you (if any).

7. Sense distant pheromone, and if you sense any, set direction on it.

Ants don't always follow the rules regarding their movement, sometimes
they just walk randomly.

Configuration parameters can be found in the Config.js file.

Note: In the stylesheet you need to make all child divs of the View
node absolutely positioned. Otherwise nothing will work.
